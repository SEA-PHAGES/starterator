  <title>Introduction</title>
	<p>Starterator outputs a single PDF with 2 elements per pham. The first is a visual representation – a graph - of the various start sites set in a display of the Clustal alignments.  The second is a text file that has a verbal description that matches the visual display.  </p>

  <title> Graphic Representation </title>
  <p> The first element of the report for a Pham is the graph representing the genes in the Pham and their candidate start sites. Each track represents a set of genes in the Pham that have the same alignment, candidate start sites, and called start site. The legend for each track can be found in the text report. The called start site of each track is blue, while other start sites are various colors.  The color of the other start sites is consistent across the genes and numbered in order of appearance in </p>

    <p> Interpretation </p>
      <list>
        <item><p>All 4 members of Pham 3205 have the same ORF length. </p></item>
        <item><p>The first three tracks show a gap in the Clustal alignment at the right end.</p></item>
        <item><p>All Tracks have 5 identical start choices.  Track 3 has one addition start choice (#6). </p></item>
        <item><p>Tracks 1, 3, and 4 have called the same start. </p></item>
        <item><p>All 4 members of Pham 3205 have the same ORF length. </p></item>
        <item><p>Investigation is needed to interpret the start prediction of Track 2.  The most likely interpretation is that the start of the genes listed in Track 2 is incorrect and should be reassigned. </p></item>

    <title>Text Report </title>
    <p> 
      The text report contains the legend for the Visual Representation   report.  It is divided into seven sections:
    </p>
  <steps>
    <item><p>
      Track ‘Members’:  The first section in the text report identifies the genes that have identical sequences to what is displayed in each track. 
    </p></item>
    <item><p> 
      Most Called Start:  The number displayed here represents the start choice as identified on the visual representation.  All genes of Pham 3205 are included here, except the genes in Track 2.
    </p></item>
    <item><p>
      Percent with start called:  This is followed by the % of genes (of that Pham) that have called that start.  In this case, 71.4%
    </p></item>
    <item><p> 
      Genes that call the most called start:  The next item lists the genes with that called start (Gens of Tracks 1, 3, and 4).
    </p></item>
    <item><p>
      Genes that have the most called start but do not call it:  Next, there is list of genes that have that start but didn’t call it (which are the genes identified in Track 2). 
    </p></item>
    <item><p>
      Genes that do not have the most called start:  This list of genes identifies genes that do not have the start that is most often called.  In this example, there was no such call.
    </p></item>
    <item><p>
      Other starts called:  Here, the list contains the genes from Track 2.  
   </p></item>
